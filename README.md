Mega Man X AR/VR Game

Built as a passion project/homage my favorite game from childhood. 

iPhone app that incorporates machine learning to detect a handheld controller, augmented reality/virtual reality for displaying fired shots and enemies.

Play as Mega Man and use a double sided hand controller to fire or charge your x-blaster. Enemies will spawn in a 180 degree range in front of you, then move towards your position. If they collide, you lose health, as indicated in the health bar on the left side of the screen. Inculdes blaster upgrade if you defeat 10 enemies, just like original game.
